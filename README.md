#Text-to-speech-ChatBot-NLP-Based


 Note that pygame, speechrecognation libraries etc. are not executed despite having being imported in the notebook.
 
 
 
 A simple Chatbot, python based (NLP) NLTK based enabled with text to speech, Which extracts and executes responses with correspondence to the query which is asked, it can be applied to any topic or subject related matter as long as it is stored in the text corpora.
 
 
 
Despite the few glitches ,slow processing and limited cognitive skills overall it serves its purpose as itâ€™s assigned to be executed with basic NLP libraries and function being used for it purpose.
      For future endeavor I would be looking forward to more generative approach by experimenting with Deep learning bot by implementing and updating the current Chatbot (RanBot) ,seq2seq (Recurrent neural network),with word embedded set for higher accuracy and  response precision along side voice activation using speech recognition module for triggering input and Keras api for  high computation.
